NOTES ON THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS:

     mtest has been run under UNIX, DOS, Macintosh, TOPS-20, and VMS.  It is a
very primitive interface, however, and is suited mainly as a model of how to
write a main program for c-client.  You should take a look at the source to
figure out how to use it.  Briefly, it first asks for a mailbox name (either a
local file path or an IMAP mailbox in the form "{hostname}mailbox") and then
puts you in a command mode where "?" will give you a list of commands.

     The Pine mailer for UNIX and DOS uses c-client, and is available
separately on the FTP.CAC.Washington.EDU archives.

			       UNIX BUILD NOTES

     A change has been made from previous versions of the IMAP toolkit.
There are no longer separate ANSI and non-ANSI source trees.  Nor is it
possible to build directly on the source tree.  Instead, you *must* build
through the top-level imap-4/Makefile, which will run a "process" step the
first time and create the imap-4/c-client, imap-4/ipopd, and imap-4/imapd
directories in which building actually takes place.

     Before doing a make on UNIX, you should read imap-4/Makefile and see if
your system type is known.  The various system types are three-letter codes.
If your system type is known, then use this as the make option.  After the
first time you do a make, this option is remembered in a file called OSTYPE,
so just typing "make" suffices.

     For example, if you are using an IBM AIX 3.2 system on an RS/6000, your
system type is a32, and the appropriate command is:
	make a32

     There are other make options, described in imap-4/src/osdep/Makefile.  A
common additional option is to enable the mbox driver, which will move mail
from /usr/spool/mail into a file called mbox in the user's home directory.
This is done by specifying the EXTRADRIVERS variable, as in:
	make a32 EXTRADRIVERS=mbox

     It's probably best to see if an existing port will work on your system
before inventing a new port.  Try:
	sv4		generic SVR4
	a32		modern SVR4, SVR4 with gcc
	bsd		basic 4.3 BSD
	nxt, mct, gul	modern BSD, BSD with gcc

     If you must invent a new port, you need to create an entry in
imap-4/Makefile and imap-4/src/osdep/Makefile for your new port, as well as
osdep/os_???.h and osdep/os_???.c files with the appropriate OS-dependent
support for that system.  You also need to determine which setup process to
use.  You should use the ua process unless you are sure that your compiler
supports *ALL* aspects of ANSI C prototyping.  Note that some compilers, such
as Ultrix, support some aspects of ANSI C but not others; c-client really
beats on the full prototyping capability of ANSI C so you have to use the
non-ANSI source tree for such systems.

     If you send a new port back to us, we will make it available for others
who use your particular system type.

     WARNING: The MacMint (mnt) and SVR2 (sv2) ports are *incomplete*.
Neither of these systems appear to have any way to do ftruncate(), which is
needed by the bezerk, mbox, mmdf, mtx, and tenex drivers.  Additionally, I was
never able to get the interface code to MacTCP working with MacMint, so on the
mnt port the imap4, nntp, pop3, and smtp drivers are also useless.  I
abandoned MacMint after I got MachTen.

			   UNIX INSTALLATION NOTES

     Binaries from the build are:
	imap-4/mtest/mtest		c-client testbed program
	imap-4/ipopd/ipop2d		POP2 daemon
	imap-4/ipopd/ipop3d		POP3 daemon
	imap-4/imapd/imapd		IMAP4 daemon

     mtest is normally not used except by c-client developers.  The ipop2d,
ipop3d, and imapd daemons should be installed in a system daemon directory,
and invoked by your /etc/inetd.conf file with lines such as:

pop	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/etc/ipop2d	ipop2d
pop3	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/etc/ipop3d	ipop3d
imap	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/etc/imapd	imapd

     Note that different variants of UNIX have different versions of inetd,
so you should verify the precise form of these commands (for example, some
versions of inetd do not require the "nowait").

     You may also have to edit your /etc/services (or Yellow Pages,
NetInfo, etc. equivalent) to register these services, such as:

pop		109/tcp
pop3		110/tcp
imap		143/tcp

     If you want to enable the rimap capability, which allows users with a
suitable client and .rhosts file on the server to access IMAP services
without transmitting her password in the clear over the network, you need
to have /etc/rimapd as a link to the real copy of imapd.  Assuming you have
imapd installed on /usr/local/etc as above:
	% ln -s /usr/local/etc/imapd /etc/rimapd

     Technical note: rimap works by having the client routine tcp_aopen()
invoke `rsh _host_ exec /etc/rimapd' in an child process, and then returning
pipes to that process' standard I/O instead of a TCP socket.  You can set up
`e-mail only accounts' by making the shell be something which accepts only
that string and not ordinary UNIX shell commands.

		       NT BUILD AND INSTALLATION NOTES

     You need to have both Visual C 2.0 and some version of the Win32 SDK
installed.  For some reason, Microsoft decided not to include several of the
NT system functions in the Win32 API.  If you get errors while building
os_nt.c that LogonUser() is undefined, it's a good bet that you don't have
the SDK installed and/or in your path properly.

     There is also considerable debate about how new mail is to be snarfed.
I am currently using something that seems to work with WinSMTP.  Look at
the definition of MAILFILE in imap-4/src/osdep/nt/os_nt.h and at the
sysinbox() function in imap-4/src/osdep/nt/env_nt.c to see what's there
now, so you have a clue about how to hack it.

     There is no shared mailbox locking in this version of NT.  As far as
I can tell, NT doesn't offer it at the UNIX level.

     To build under NT, connect to the imap-4 directory and do:
	nmake -f makefile.nt
The resulting binaries will be:
	imap-4\mtest\mtest.exe		(testbed client)
	imap-4\ipopd\ipop2d.exe		POP2 server
	imap-4\ipopd\ipop3d.exe		POP3 server
	imap-4\imapd\imapd.exe		IMAP4 server

     These servers are stdio servers.  I wrote a simple network listener
for NT called inetlisn; currently it is available as:
	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/nt/inetlisn.tar
To build this, use "nmake" after connecting to the inetlisn directory.
inetlisn takes two arguments, the first being the port number and the second
being the binary to run to serve a connection on that port, e.g.
	c:\bin\inetlisn 143 c:\mail_daemons\imapd

     Note that NT imapd must be started as SYSTEM in order to be recognized as
being "not logged in"; otherwise it will preauth as whatever user it is
running as which is probably not what you want.  One way to have it run as
system is to have inetlisn run by an AT command, e.g. if the time now is
2:05PM, try something like:
	AT 14:06 "c:\bin\inetlisn 143 c:\mail_daemons\imapd"

			       DOS BUILD NOTES

     If you are building a DOS client, you will need a TCP/IP stack installed
on your DOS system along with its development environment.  The currently
supported stacks are Beame & Whiteside, PC-NFS, Novell, PC/IP, Waterloo, and
Winsock.  mtest and a version of Pine called PC Pine run under DOS.

      You do not use imap-4/Makefile under DOS, nor do you build any
components other than c-client.  Merge the contents of imap-4/src/c-client and
imap-4/src/osdep/dos onto a single directory on DOS and build from that.  The
MAKE command on DOS takes an argument identifying the TCP/IP stack in use.
For example, do:
	MAKE MAKEFILE OS=WSK   (or MAKE -F MAKEFILE OS=WSK)
to build for Winsock.  

			    MACINTOSH BUILD NOTES

     If you are building a Macintosh client, you will need MacTCP installed on
your system as well as the MacTCP C includes and libraries.  I use THINK C.

      You do not use imap-4/Makefile on the Mac, nor do you build any
components other than c-client and mtest.  Merge the contents of
imap-4/src/c-client, imap-4/src/mtest, and imap-4/src/osdep/mac onto a single
directory on the Mac and build from that.  mtext.sit.hqx is a THINK C project
file and cute icon for building mtest, encoded with Binhex and StuffIt.

     If you use precompiled headers, you may get some compilation errors since
some Apple symbols need to be redefined in order to get it to build under all
versions of MacOS.  Try turning off the precompiled headers (so it will
re-read the .h files) and see if it builds any better.

     If you use a Mac C compiler with 2-byte ints (such as THINK C's normal
mode) you will need to fix some bugs in the MacTCP C includes and libraries to
prevent it from generating bad code, since those MacTCP files violate Apple's
standards of always using explicit shorts or longs, never ints.  You could
avoid this if you set 4-byte ints in THINK C; however, the ANSI and UNIX
libraries in THINK C use 2-byte ints so you will also need to build 4-byte int
versions of these.  c-client itself is 2-byte int or 4-byte int clean; it can
be used in either mode.

     The most important bug in the MacTCP files that you need to fix is in the
file AddressXlation.h, you need to change the definition of the rtnCode member
of the hostInfo structure to be long instead of int.  There are several other
changes you need to make if you decide to compile dnr.c under THINK C instead
of using the Apple-supplied object file; see me for details if you decide to
undertake such an effort.  This is fixed in newer versions from Apple.

			     TOPS-20 BUILD NOTES

     I have provided a c-client port for TOPS-20 systems, but you're on your
own in terms of a nice TOPS-20 like main program.  Maybe someday some nice
person will try porting Pine to TOPS-20.  I recently built mtest on TOPS-20
(thank you, XKL!!), so the sources are known to compile with the ANSI C
version of KCC.

      You do not use imap-4/Makefile under TOPS-20, nor do you build any
components other than c-client.  Merge the contents of imap-4/src/c-client,
imap-4/src/mtest, and imap-4/src/osdep/tops-20 onto a single directory on
TOPS-20 and build from that.  The command:
	DO BUILD.CTL
will build the sources.  If you don't have MIC, then SUBMIT BUILD.CTL and let
BATCON execute it.

			       VMS BUILD NOTES

     This port is based upon files sent to me by Yehavi Bourvine,
Yehavi@VMS.HUJI.AC.IL, for the IMAP2bis toolkit.  I included the stuff that
I could get to work on a VMS system at UW.

      You do not use imap-4/Makefile under VMS, nor do you build any
components other than c-client.  Merge the contents of imap-4/src/c-client,
imap-4/src/mtest, and imap-4/src/osdep/VMS-20 onto a single directory on VMS
and build from that.  The command to build it is:
	@BUILD MULTINET
or	@BUILD NETLIB
If you just do @BUILD it will build with dummy TCP code, and since only TCP
based drivers are provided here this isn't too useful.

     If you aren't on the Pacific coast of the US or Canada, you probably will
need to change the wired-in timezone in the BUILD.COM file.  Apparently, the
wonderful VMS system that DEC loves so much doesn't maintain any concept of
time zone.  In fact, the VMS C compiler returns a null pointer from gmtime()!

     Otherwise you're pretty much on your own here.  Ask Yehavi for help, not
me.  Yehavi has a VMS local mail driver so you can get local mail services.
